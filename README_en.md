## ✍️ Why LocalProse?

Stop renting your intelligence to Cloud AI services. 
**LocalProse** is a writing workshop that runs on **YOUR** machine.

* **🏠 100% On-Device AI :** Your drafts and ideas stay on your hard drive. No one is reading over your shoulder. No data is sent to the cloud.
* **♾️ Zero credit limits :** Test 50 variations of a sentence if you want. No counter is ticking. The "right to waste" is restored.
* **🎙️ Speak, it's written :** Built-in voice dictation (speech-to-text) module. Capture your ideas at the speed of thought.
